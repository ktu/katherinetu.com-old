My co-op term has ended and school starts again later today, and I took the opportunity, after an enjoyable day with my parents, to rearrange my room. The bed had been the centrepiece and was so close to the desk that the chair could only be pushed out about two feet back, so I developed a habit of using the bed as a desk. That, coupled with some health problems, did not help my hypersomnia. Now that I'm on medication that makes me able to stay awake for more than eight hours a day, I chanced pushing my bed to the end of my room, so that there is now much more floorspace (whose area once made up the foot-long border around my bed), and so that my desk is much more usable and not incredibly uncomfortable. My room, in general, looks a lot less cluttered.</p>
<p>
I also decided to clean up the quasi-cesspool that was forming on my laptop, what with two year's worth of university work, memos, chat logs, and other files all thrown into My Documents. I think I'm generally a messy but organised person (or at least I aim to be) &ndash; and there is a difference. My high school English teacher who had piles of papers strewn on her desk but had the uncanny ability to reach into said pile and find the exact paper that a student asks about, for example, was messy but organised. However, usually, if a space becomes messy enough, it will affect organisation, and it's at that point that it turns into an environment where I can no longer efficiently work. For the past year or so, I rarely did work on my laptop &ndash; I would always have to go to a computer lab in order to concentrate. Hopefully, these changes will make it easier to work at home so that I'm not stranded on campus at 4am with two and a half hours to wait before my first bus.</p>
<p>
What I'm worried about more, though, is the clutter in my life that are more abstract than literal. Everything is a bit of a mess right now, though not as bad as it can be or had been, and I'm frightened &ndash; more than I'm likely to admit &ndash; of what will happen this semester. I did terribly last academic semester. I broke up with my boyfriend of four years the weekend before midterms and was accompanied by him the week following, and for the last month or so of the semester, found it exceedingly difficult to remain conscious. I'm afraid things will happen again this semester because there are many issues that haven't yet been fully resolved, or issues that could likely resurface, or new issues that could arise, but more than that, I'm afraid that those things are just poor excuses that I made for myself, and that I really don't belong here after all. </p>

<p>
I suppose it is too early to say, though. All I can really do now is to be positive, do my best, and learn from the last semester's mistakes. </p>
