<p>My professor likes taking a few minutes to talk about math history on Fridays, since it’s a first-year course. Alexandria, named after Alexander the Great and whose rule was succeeded by Ptolemy I, was the pinnacle of academia back in about 300BC. It housed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_of_Alexandria">a library with millions of books</a>, including <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid%27s_Elements">a thirteen-volume set written by Euclid</a>, back when the printing press was not yet invented.</p>

<p>A religious war erupted in about 300AD that destroyed much of Alexandria’s infrastructure, including the library. Byzantine was the centre of Christian rule at the time, so some books made their way there. The rise of Islam in 750AD yet again brought war to eastern Europe and the middle-east, but some of the Islamic conquests, including both Byzantine and Alexandria, resulted in the possession of some books. Islamic scholars were keen on preserving them, and many of them made their way to Islamic-ruled southern Spain in Cordoba, which became the new academic centre of Europe. First from Greek to Arabic, then from Arabic to Latin, Euclid’s work was translated and read by later mathematicians and scientists like Einstein.</p>

<p>Yup. Pretty interesting.</p>
