<p>I've been relatively occupied lately, though not quite busy in the sense that I'm actually being productive. I've basically been living in the math and computing building on campus, bumming around the <a href="mathsoc.uwaterloo.ca">mathematics society</a> office, trying to take care of administrative things in the labs and by running around campus, and plucking away at my work term report. It took me all of the first week and large doses of <a href="http://dailybunny.org/">the Daily Bunny</a> to finish my work report. My rabbits are a hundred times cuter, though:</p>

My first few days of school have been pretty amazing &ndash; I've caught up with some friends, had lunch with a few people, and my classes so far are fairly interesting. My statistics class is far more theoretical than the one I took two semesters ago, which is definitely more appealing. The two computer science courses are sort of making a gradual crawl through some fundamental basics before, hopefully, moving on to more engaging topics (one is covering UNIX and the other basic boolean algebra and Karnaugh maps).</p>

<p>There was a Google information session yesterday, which was super fun! Also, I saw Cate Huston again, which made it even more super. We were split into groups of five and given Google Games puzzle booklets. I was in a group with two upper-year students and two girls in <a href="http://www.mathbus.uwaterloo.ca/programs/financial.html">CFM</a> who were all very friendly and awesome. Me and the CFM team mate sitting beside me solved a puzzle, and her friend solved one by herself! Although I was a bit jealous of the people who received awesome Android plush toys, I had a lot of fun. My friend from software engineering and I headed over to the <a href="http://www.mathnews.uwaterloo.ca/">mathNEWS</a> production meeting, where we worked on Putogether. I solved Robot Maze at home and fell into a twelve-hour comatose because I had forgotten to take my medication. </p>
