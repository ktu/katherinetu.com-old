So I've finally gotten around to redesigning my website. It was really messy and cluttered, so hopefully it's a little better now. My blog has been migrated from WordPress to Jekyll, which is pretty cool, although I'm still getting a feel for it. <a href='http://dmitryblotsky.com'>Dmitry</a> set up and hosts my new site, so yay, Dmitry! There are still a lot of layout and functional tweaks and pages I need to work on, but it's 3AM and I should probably go to sleep soon.
