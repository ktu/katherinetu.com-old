<p>Interspecies friendships are some of the most fantastic things ever. Firstly, they're animals, which in and of themselves are amazing. However, having different species interact and seeing them get along is even more amazing. It's not simply coexistence, even though that is not quite as trite for humans as it sounds, but genuine friendships woven together without the social context &ndash; or even oral communication &ndash; to which humans are so accustomed.  </p>
