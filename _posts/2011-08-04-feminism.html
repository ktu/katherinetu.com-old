<p>I was actually going to write this post after I did a quick check of my Google+ stream and came across someone who posted a <a href="http://thoughtcatalog.com/2011/the-definition-of-feminism/">Thought Catalogue article on feminism</a>, except from a male perspective, reminding girl-bashing "feminists" to not loathe thy neighbour. </p>

<p>
The word "feminism" has a terrible stigma attached to it. When people ask, "Are you feminist?" their tone is akin to asking, "You ate <i>all</i> of the biscuits?" when instead they should instead sound like, "You do like these chocolate biscuits, right?" because by definition, feminism is: </p>

<blockquote>The advocacy of women's rights on the grounds of political, social, and economic equality to men. &mdash; <i><a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=feminism">Google Dictionary</a></i></blockquote>

<blockquote>1. the theory of the political, economic, and social equality of the sexes
<br />2. organized activity on behalf of women's rights and interests &mdash; <i><a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/feminism">Merriam-Webster</a></i></blockquote>

<p>
And according to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feminism">Wikipedia</a>: </p>

<blockquote>Feminism is a collection of movements aimed at defining, establishing, and defending equal political, economic, and social rights and equal opportunities for women. Its concepts overlap with those of women's rights. Feminism is mainly focused on women's issues, but because feminism seeks gender equality, some feminists argue that men's liberation is therefore a necessary part of feminism, and that men are also harmed by sexism and gender roles. Feminists are "person[s] whose beliefs and behavior[s] are based on feminism."</blockquote>

<p>
If feminism is about <a href="http://www.thefword.org.uk/features/2003/09/feminists_are_sexist">gender equality</a>, why do people act as if feminists are men (and I suppose, now, women) haters that should be feared and abhorred? Evidently, some part of the message came across wrong there. </p>

<p>
My best friend and I share many of the same beliefs, and since we were young, we've both avidly advocated animal welfare and gay rights. However, she is an outspoken feminist, whereas I had always shied away from those issues. It wasn't until more recently that I've asked myself why. </p>

<p>
One of the reasons, I suppose, is that much of the feminism discussed in this context are first-world issues. Compared to people in the rest of the world, women are given so many more rights and privileges. Looking from it at another angle, however, in almost every nation, women have fewer rights and privileges than men &ndash; first-world ones included. It would be ludicrous, moreover, to step back from an issue because there's <i>more inequality</i> somewhere else; I should be advocating for equality everywhere. </p>

<p>
The issue, I think, lies a little deeper than that.</p>


<p>I'm afraid to say that I've already succumbed to the narrative of media and society, or at least I had and have only begun to realise it. My significant other during high school always made note of attractive women to me and jokingly called me fat. It made me increasingly insecure, but for a while I did little but try to watch my food consumption and pretty myself up with makeup and dresses. </p>

<p>
When I went to university, I was hundreds of kilometres away from anyone I knew. Because of the distance, I was even more determined on being the Perfect Girlfriend &ndash; whatever that meant. I began to eat one meal per day. I forced myself to exercise on an empty stomach. I visited pro-ana websites. I found pictures of skinny girls and taped them over food containers. I watched my weight and counted calories. I did all of this with the thought that if I succeeded, I would be a better girlfriend. I was convinced that my self-worth was measured by how thin my legs were, and that I had to be the best little trophy girlfriend I could be for my significant other because that was what everyone wanted from me.</p>

<p>
I never did succeed, of course. My single meals ended up being larger than regular meals, so I consumed about two meals worth of calories a day. It was also incredibly difficult to take five engineering courses with very little energy, and I became even more frustrated when I realised that I could not conserve energy and study at the same time.</p>

<p>
I've only recently begun to accept myself again, and I'm incredibly hesitant to admit all of it. But this narrative &ndash; that a woman's value is measured by appearance; that a woman's job is to satisfy the men around them &ndash; is harmful and most definitely real. </p>
