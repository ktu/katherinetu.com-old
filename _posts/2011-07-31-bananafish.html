<p>I slipped out of the apartment in the morning for some fresh air. It turns out that most stores in Uptown Waterloo are closed on Sundays, which I discovered at some point earlier in the semester but completely overlooked it until I got off the bus. The book store, however, was open, and I stared at its classics shelves for several minutes before picking out JD Salinger's anthology of <i>Nine Stories</i> and a book for a friend. </p>

<p>
Studying for statistics seemed rather daunting, so I proceeded to read the first two stories in his anthology. I liked <i>Catcher in the Rye</i>; it was fast-paced and read like the musings of an adolescent (which it was supposed to be, so in this regard it was incredibly well-written). Holden and, as I found out today, many of Salinger's characters are dislikable on the surface, but their sheer complexity redeems them. Even if being complex also makes the character hypocritical, they are forgivable because of how <i>human</i> they are. Salinger writes in such a way that scenes - actions, dialogue, and perhaps even thoughts - are presented without giving away the emotions of the characters, so that when the protagonist pulls the trigger, the question lingers: <i>why</i>?</p>
<p>
In a sense, I think this is one of the most effective ways of portraying emotion. Aside from hyperbolic metaphors of classical elements or comparisons to our sense of touch, what better than to leave it up to the reader to empathise? Emotions often aren't quantifiable even by something as subjective as frowns and smiles; insanity isn't as evident as maniacal laughter. Sometimes things can't be adequately grasped or measured. As hard as we try to find methods for describing them, emotions, like infinite series, can at most be approximated. </p>
