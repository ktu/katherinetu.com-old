<p><b>The following contains spoilers for the <i>Harry Potter</i> series and <i>Atlas Shrugged</i>.</b></p>

<p>
In her <i>Harry Potter</i> series JK Rowling separates ambition and kindness into two mutually-exclusive categories. Those who are kind belong in Hufflepuff, and those who are ambitious are in Slytherin; any newly-admitted Hogwarts student coming from a line of Slytherins would hate to end up in Hufflepuff. Rowling equates ambition with cunning, greed, power-hunger, and selfishness, and Hufflepuffs seem to be the useless background characters &ndash; all of the really "kind" characters end up in Gryffindor. </p>

<p>
Rowling has a clear morality that she tries to make clear throughout the series through <i>tell</i>, but through <i>show</i> in the last two novels or so detracts from it. Love thine enemies? McGonagall <i>praises</i> Harry when he performs an unforgivable curse on a Death Eater. Not all Slytherins are evil? No, but most of them are, and only about five of them aren't completely detestable &ndash; and don't worry, little Albus, it's all right if the Sorting Hat says that you might belong in Slytherin, but you can choose to go to Gryffindor, which you will no doubt do.</p>

<p>
Given the very nature of the Houses, Severus should have been a Hufflepuff or Gryffindor, and Dumbledore a Slytherin. The Houses are supposed to tell the <i>true</i> nature of a character. Severus, despite it all, keeps his word to Dumbledore until the very end because of his respect for him and his love for Lily. This is not what Rowling's base definition of a Slytherin would do. Likewise, Dumbledore predicts and plots everyone's actions until his very death, including those that would occur after his death. He is not evil, and Rowling insists that Slytherins aren't, but he is cunning and manipulative, if only for the Greater Good. He is the very definition of what a Slytherin should be &ndash; unless, of course, Rowling hadn't intended him to come off the way he did.</p>

<p>
On the other side of the spectrum, we have Ayn Rand, who, setting aside the fact that her main protagonist <a href="http://attitudeadjustment.tripod.com/Speeches/IR-01-01.htm">commits homicide because the victim was indecisive</a> and that Rand herself <a href="http://www.michaelprescott.net/hickman.htm">puts a sociopathic killer on a pedestal</a>, can very well portray her philosophy in several novels. All of her characters are either proponents of her philosophy, to the point where they can read each others' minds and to the further point that she believes that <i>good</i> art only can only have one interpretation, or philosophical <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawmanPolitical">strawmen</a> with thoughts of static.</p>

<p>
Rand brands selflessness as something awful; it seems as though every time the word "charity" is uttered, a character explodes into a sea of word vomit &ndash; <i>charity</i>? Who has need for the likes of <i>charity</i>? That would mean sacrificing yourself for others, exposing yourself to the looters and moochers, ultimately leading to your own destruction! This is our oath: "I swear, by my life, and my love of it, that I will never live for the sake of another man, and never ask another man to live for mine." What would compel you to break that oath, to sink down to such levels as <i>charity</i>? Charity means sacrifice, and it is the looters' virtue that is based on sacrifice &ndash; that is why they sacrifice ability for incompetence, reason for faith, independence for unity, justice for mercy, happiness to duty, and self-esteem to self-denial!</p>

<p>
However, she takes a dip when she admits that it is possible to do things for others without condemning yourself to baseness. You do it for people that you respect, and either contenting a person you respect will give you pleasure, or they will gain from it and eventually give back to you indirectly. </p>

<p>
She is all for hard work and ambition, and it is for these ideals that she is held in such esteem. She believes that effort is true merit, and those that gain without it are "looters" and "moochers". She believes in hard work not only as a means to a goal, but the goal itself &ndash; gaining knowledge, talent, and contributing to society are only natural by-products to effort. She believes, to the point of extremity, that a person is able to get anywhere with enough effort. This isn't necessarily true, and certainly not the point that Rand insists, because opportunity and working <i>efficiently</i> are also important things to keep in mind, but I'd like to think that her beliefs are based on the thought that, while we're alive, we should always do things whole-heartedly. But why not take these ideals a step further? Why not combine ambition with a non-self-destructive idea of charity, compassion, and kindness?</p>

<p>
The <a href="http://blog.miaouaf.net/2011/on-compassion/">video on compassion</a> and many of the blogs I follow made me realise that, at least in the IT industry, many of the people gotten far because they were ambitious, but, in turn, only because of their desire to change the world. They wanted to do something great, something wonderful, which only came naturally from knowing how beautiful the world &ndash; and the whole universe &ndash; was. It's like empowering the Hufflepuffs &ndash; fueled by, instead of the Gryffindors' raw courage or the Slytherins' cunning, love and compassion. </p>

<p>
Because in Hufflepuff, we're all Muggles or Muggle-born and work excruciatingly hard to produce the tiniest spark of magic, but when we do, it lights up the hearts of those around us. We, who may or may not have been bullied as children, are empathetic toward the non-athletically-inclined or those with odd interests in funny Muggle machines, and are sympathetic toward even the likes of Draco and Severus. We may not be Chosen Ones or Ones Who Cannot Be Named, but we are kind &ndash; and goodness knows we need more kindness in the world.</p>

<p>
In other news, I was so psyched when I realised that my <a href="http://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/uWaterloo-Colours">school's colours</a> are the same as Hufflepuff's. Ravenclaws are pretty awesome too, except we all know they're going to grow up being researchers and professors.</p>
