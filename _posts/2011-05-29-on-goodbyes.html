<p>It has been a while since my last update; I was debating on moving to a different domain and wanted to postpone any blag updates until after the wobsite had been moved, but I finally decided to leave that until this domain is a little closer to its expiry date.</p>
<p>
School has been good, though I admit I have a little trouble with time management. One day, I'll be sitting and reading my textbook ahead of the class because all of the assignments for that week have been completed, and the next, I'll be sitting with four unfinished assignments due in a matter of days. I am currently in the latter situation. Though I've been ridiculously content as of late, I sense that things will begin slipping fairly soon, as it consistently does every few weeks. Hopefully my medication will be able to postpone that until after my stats midterm. </p>

I've joined a Dungeons and Dragons 4.0 campaign in which I play a Tiefling bard. Since the first session, I've managed to blow the heads off two enemy creatures and intimidate a few of my party members. Roughly with the same crowd, I participated in the second <a href="http://www.sehackday.com/">SE Hack Day</a>. Dmitry and I are writing a code-to-midi translator that produces a characteristic song based on the elegance of the code, which is currently in a private repository on <a href="http://bitbucket.org">BitBucket</a>. I've also been relatively involved with MathSoc and WiM, the latter of which had its first event a few days ago.</p>
<p>
Amidst the flurry of recent events, I've realised that my university experience thus far &ndash; at least since I've arrived at the University of Waterloo &ndash; has been better than I could have ever imagined. At some point in my life, I began to fear change, and going to university was one change to which I had not looked forward. When I was younger, change meant little to me; I recall standing at the back of the classroom with the boys in my class on the last day of school in seventh grade, watching all of the other girls huddle and cry with one another. As the future grew less certain for me, I suppose, and as I gained more ties with the people around me, change became something that was not altogether welcomed.</p>
<p>
As humans, we revere the idea of permanence but abhor the thought of the ephemeral. We want things to last forever &ndash; our consciousness, our ideas, our memories, our relationships &ndash; and shake at the thought of these things ending. We fear that one day they will cease to exist as if they had never at all existed. We fear the thought of <i>never again</i>, the idea that we may never again have something. No matter how much something was cherished during the time it was there, losing it tears at our hearts and fills us with regret. Why did it end? What if I had done something different? What if things had happened another way?</p>
<p>
Someone once asked me why so many people end relationships as soon as they realise that it won't last forever. It's because, I told him, we all hold futures filled with uncertainty. We want as much as we can to create things that are constant &ndash; static, final &ndash; even if we are aware that very few things last a long time, and that none will last forever. We don't want to throw our hearts at something that we know will end before we do; we fear, with every bit of our being, that one day those hands clasped in ours can no longer be reached, that the smiles that brighten our day will be but fragments of our memories, and that the feelings that we held so dear will one day fade to nothing. </p>
<p>
But goodbyes, as much as hellos, are sometimes necessary. And when we are the ones to realise this, we want so much to convince ourselves otherwise. We want so much to believe that things can last forever if only we gave it a chance, if only we tried hard enough, if only we reached a little further, ran a little harder. And harder it is still to utter goodbye and know that things would go back to being the way they were if only you turned around. I heard someone once asked why some breakups were like a cold stake through the heart &ndash; one of the replies was that it was because they needed to burn the bridges and so that they could never turn back. </p>
<p>
A friend of mine reminded me that endings only hurt proportional to the happiness you felt at the time. Maybe all that we need is to hold on to those happy memories and do our best to move on.</p>
