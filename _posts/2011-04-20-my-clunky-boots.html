Last summer, I wore heels nearly every single day, partially due to my feeling self-conscious beside my then-boyfriend, who was about nine inches taller. It was also because I wanted to ASSIMILATE!! with society, and dressing nicely is often a good way of doing this. I had two pairs of fancy heels that were a size too large for me, and one of them had metal sticking out of it by the end of the first day that I wore it. Mission failed!? Granted, I had walked down a highway that morning because I missed my transfer bus, which in the suburbia of Bell's Corners only came once every thirty minutes during rush hour. There were many days in which I spent hours walking in heels until my feet were covered in blisters and I had to pause for breaks because it was painful to stand. I suppose the lesson learnt here is that heels aren't made for oddballs who enjoy walking long distances, no matter how comfortable they may seem when you first wear them. </p>

Almost every day this work term, in contrast, I've been wearing my clunky boots, similarly worn. They have holes on their soles, so they tend to absorb moisture as I walk through snow or rain, quite of the opposite of their original purpose. People tend to give me weird looks whenever I describe my footwear, since I suppose most people replace them before their heels start rattling with pebbles. I've been meaning to buy new boots, but keep reasoning to myself that it really isn't necessary &ndash; the winter is almost over and it's not as if it will snow in <i>May</i> &ndash; it's not so bad if I walk on my toes &ndash; but sooner or later it will be necessarily. Hopefully "sooner or later" will be before next winter.</p>
