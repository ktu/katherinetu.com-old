<blockquote>It eluded us then, but that's no matter &mdash; tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther... And one fine morning &mdash;
So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past. &mdash;<i>F. Scott Fitzgerald (The Great Gatsby, 1925)</i></blockquote>

<blockquote>If you've found meaning in your life, you don't want to go back. You want to go forward. &mdash;<i>Mitch Albom (Tuesdays with Morrie, 1997)</i></blockquote>

<blockquote>Nous cherchons tous le bonheur, mais sans sachant o&ugrave;, comme les ivrognes qui cherchent leurs maisons, sachant confus&eacute;ment qu'ils en ont une.
(<i>We're all searching for happiness, but without knowing where, like drunkards looking for their houses while vaguely knowing that they have one.</i>) &mdash;<i>Voltaire</i></blockquote>

<blockquote>The world is so exquisite with so much love and moral depth [...] Far better it seems to me, in our vulnerability, is to look death in the eye and to be grateful every day for the brief but magnificent opportunity that life provides. &mdash;<i>Carl Sagan ("In the Valley of the Shadow", 1996)</i></blockquote>

<blockquote>If nothing we do matters, then all that matters is what we do. &mdash;<i>Joss Whedon (Angel, 2004) via Emma</i></blockquote>

<blockquote>What is really hard, and really amazing, is giving up on being perfect and beginning the hard work of becoming yourself. [...] Someday, sometime, you will be sitting somewhere. A berm overlooking a pond in Vermont. The lip of the Grand Canyon at sunset. A seat on the subway. And something bad will have happened: You will have lost someone you loved, or failed at something at which you badly wanted to succeed.<br />

And sitting there, you will fall into the center of yourself. You will look for some core to sustain you. And if you have been perfect all your life and have managed to meet all the expectations of your family, your friends, your community, your society, chances are excellent that there will be a black hole where that core ought to be. [...] It is never to late to be what you might have been.</blockquote> &mdash;Anne Quindlen (Being Perfect, 2005) <i>via <a href="http://www.catehuston.com/blog/2011/04/20/being-perfect/trackback/">Cate Huston</a></i>
