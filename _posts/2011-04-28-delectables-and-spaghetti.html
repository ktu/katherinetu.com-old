<p>With the semester coming close to an end, a couple of fellow co-ops and I decided to venture uptown to buy some farewell gifts for one another. We went to several fair-trade trinket stores, which are full of delectable goods like <a href="http://www.thinkgeek.com/geektoys/cubegoodies/98a6/">staple-free staplers</a> and wooden African wildlife-themed chess sets. Afterward, one of them gave me a tour through the nearby park, which features a mini-menagerie of barn animals. The rabbits, sadly, were all hiding in their hutch, but we saw some beautiful white and blue-shoulder peafowl, tiny chickens, and llamas feeding on the unfortunately short grass. We followed the lead of a mother accompanied by her toddler daughter and picked handfuls of grass to feed the donkey and miniature horses, and agreed that the donkey was the most polite feeder, since it didn't leave a clump of saliva in our hands after eating from them. </p>

Speaking of delectable goods, <a href="http://laughingsquid.com/model-of-san-francisco-made-using-100000-toothpicks/">this model</a> is absolutely amazing. We also need several of <a href="http://blog.makezine.com/archive/2009/10/periodic-table.html">these tables</a> on campus. Guys, keep your cup of coffee away from that Hg.</p>

<p>And then speaking of the co-op term coming to an end, there are a few things that I need to get done between now and the end of tomorrow &ndash; I really wanted to rewrite some of the structure of the web application that I've been working on, but due to time constraints and some other side-projects that I also need to complete (including a project that was given to me this morning that I was asked to finish by tomorrow) and my work-term report, I might have to stick with something more simple. I have an idea of what to do that won't make one of the functions frustratingly inefficient without having to spend too much time on it, but it's a little irritating that its original design severely limits the add-ons I've been requested to code. It took me a lot longer than it should have to understand the code behind that particular app; the poorly-commented, if at all, spaghetti code splits up a simple form into about five different places and looks a lot like this:</p>

which I happened to furiously doodle throughout the day I was trying to fix it.</p>

<p>This is a somewhat accurate depiction of how I looked by the end of the day, likely with agonising cries of "<i>Why?</i>" resonating in my head.</p>
