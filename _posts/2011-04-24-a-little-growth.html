<blockquote>If people tell me that it is wrong to hope, I will tell them that they're wrong every time. &mdash;<i>Gen Urobuchi (Puella Magi Madoka Magica, 2011)</i></blockquote>

<p>The season finale for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puella_Magi_Madoka_Magica">Puella Magi Madoka Magica</a> and my subsequent attempts at drawing fanart, voting at the <a href="http://www.elections.ca/content.aspx?section=vot&dir=vote&document=index&lang=e">advance polls</a>, my family, and my babies have kept me busy this long weekend. I also got a ridiculous hair cut which I tried to make up for with a cute hat. It only makes me slightly less ridiculous-looking, unfortunately.</p>

<p>The series has also spawned quite a few amazing arrangements of its soundtrack, like the haunting (and spoiler-containing) <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OMPmTzeQj0">pianoforte arrangement</a> and the <a href=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1BjdnQVzsw">music box rendition</a> of the opening theme song, which I've been listening to while drawing. They also make me want to learn piano or at least pick up my violin again. Sadly, none of my drawings have gotten past one character before being scrapped; the scenes I have planned in my head are probably too ambitious for my skill level, or I might just have set the expectations a little too high. </p>

A lot of times, I wonder why my interests are so broad and why I hadn't, growing up, decided to stick with one thing and run with it. I've tried to narrow it down in the past few years, but perhaps never enough; I need writing, at least that of my thoughts, to sustain me, and the thought of giving up on my childish doodles has never occurred to me. I love studying languages, etymology, and linguistics, and I want to learn about ecology and the environment so that I may one day be able to help the world in some way. And yet I cannot imagine a better career than one in computer science, in which creativity, innovation, and problem-solving all play an integral role. At the same time, it is computer science that has the ability to connect all of these things. Programs can serve as predictive models and simulations; client-facing systems need proper user interfaces; front-end web systems require graphic designers; and computer scientists study syntax and semantics, and the field itself affects and is affected by linguistics. The University of Toronto actually had a <a href="http://www.artsandscience.utoronto.ca/ofr/calendar/crs_csc.htm">computer science and linguistics</a> program to which I had strongly considered applying.</p>

<p>
Reading the <a href="http://www.compsciwoman.com/">CompSci Woman blog</a> made me realise that there are many computer science majors with diverse interests and talents. Most of them, if not all, are incredible writers. Some strongly considered being authors, a few have minors in foreign languages, some are incredibly athletic, and some wanted to major in completely different fields altogether before being drawn by computer science. These stories not only lay my insecurities to rest, but also inspire me to be the best that I can be.</p>
