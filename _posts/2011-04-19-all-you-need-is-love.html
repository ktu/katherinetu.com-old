Though to err is human, I believe being inherently good is also part of being human. However ignorant, however erroneous, or however broken we may be, beneath the surface, everyone is beautiful.</p>

<blockquote>For small creatures such as we the vastness is bearable only through love. &mdash;<i>Carl Sagan (Contact, 1985)</i></blockquote>

<blockquote>Every one of us is, in the cosmic perspective, precious. If a human disagrees with you, let him live. In a hundred billion galaxies, you will not find another. &mdash;<i>Carl Sagan (Cosmos, 1980)</i></blockquote>

<blockquote>Le bonheur est souvent la seule chose qu'on puisse donner sans l'avoir et c'est en le donnant quand on l'acquiert. (<i>Happiness is often the only thing we can give without possessing, and it is in giving it that we acquire it.</i>) &mdash;<i>Voltaire</i></blockquote>

<blockquote>Someone once said to Clive: do you think we will ever be forgiven for what we've done? They meant their generation and the war and what the war had done to civilization. Clive said something I've never forgotten. He said: I doubt we'll ever be forgiven. All I hope is &ndash; they'll remember we were human beings. &mdash;<i>Timothly Findley (The Wars, 1977)</i></blockquote>
