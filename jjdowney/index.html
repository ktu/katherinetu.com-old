				<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got myself into a meteor swarm, some little asteroids.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Meteors?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it&#8217;s the Myrmidone cluster that goes out past Mars and in toward Earth once every five years. I&#8217;m right in the middle. It s like a big kaleidoscope. You get all kinds of colors and shapes and sizes. God, it s beautiful, all that metal.&#8221;</p>
<p>Silence.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going with them,&#8221; said Stone. &#8220;They&#8217;re taking me off with them. I&#8217;ll be damned.&#8221; He laughed.</p>
<p>Hollis looked to see, but saw nothing. There were only the great diamonds and sapphires and emerald mists and velvet inks of space, with God&#8217;s voice mingling among the crystal fires. There was a kind of wonder and imagination in the thought of Stone going off in the meteor swarm, out past Mars for years and coming in toward Earth every five years, passing in and out of the planet&#8217;s ken for the next million centuries. Stone and the Myrmidone cluster eternal and unending, shifting and shaping like the kaleidoscope colors when you were a child and held the long tube to the sun and gave it a twirl.</p>
<p>&#8220;So long, Hollis.&#8221; Stone&#8217;s voice, very faint now. &#8220;So long.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good luck,&#8221; shouted Hollis across thirty thousand miles.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be funny,&#8221; said Stone, and was gone.</p>
<p>The stars closed in.</p></p>
